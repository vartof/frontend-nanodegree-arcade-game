Thank you for checking out my game!  It's a simple frogger style game in which the player
must traverse the screen from the bottom up, while avoiding enemies.

===============================
How to GET the game
===============================
Download my project from github @ https://github.com/vartof/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game

===============================
How to PLAY the game
===============================
Launch index.html on your preferred web browser.

Take a moment to check out the scene.

See that cool little dude at the bottom?  That is YOU.

Your job is to use the up-down-left-right keys on your keyboard, to make your way UP the screen.

When you reach the water level at the top, you have won!  You will be sent to the beginning to play again.

Be careful to give the bugs plenty of room.  They don't like anyone invading their personal space.

If you collide with a bug, you will be sent back to the beginning and will have to start all over.

All the best and I hope you have fun!
